            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>The king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is the second largest species of penguin, smaller, but somewhat similar
                in appearance to the emperor penguin. There are two subspecies: A. p. patagonicus and A. p. halli; patagonicus is
                found in the South Atlantic and halli in the South Indian Ocean (at the Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Island, Prince
                Edward Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands) and at Macquarie Island.[2]
                King penguins mainly eat lanternfish, squid and krill. On foraging trips king penguins repeatedly dive to over 100
                metres (300 ft), and have been recorded at depths greater than 300 metres (1,000 ft).[3]
                King penguins breed on the subantarctic islands at the northern reaches of Antarctica, South Georgia, and other
                temperate islands of the region.</p>

            <h2>More</h2>
            <p>Some American zoologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published
                his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to emperor penguins,and recording a dive of 235 metres
                (771 ft) by a king penguin in 1982.
            
                The current maximum dive recorded is 343 metres in the Falkland Islands region,and a maximum time submerged of 552
                seconds recorded at the Crozet Islands.
                The king penguin dives to depths of 100–300 meters (350–1000 feet), spending around five minutes submerged, during
                daylight hours, and less than 30 metres (98 ft) at night.

                The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by king penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin
                dives to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before
                returning to the surface..</p>
