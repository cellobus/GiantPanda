<h2>Fun facts</h1>
    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.
    <p>It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a <b>neighboring </b>musteloid.</p>
    <p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, <b>yams</b>, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
